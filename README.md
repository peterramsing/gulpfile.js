# gulpfile.js

Bare-bones gulp file that minifies your JS and SCSS files at run time, and watches for changes on save. 

# Dependencies 

Assuming gulp is already installed on your machine, cd to working directory and run the following:

<pre>
<code>npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-uglify gulp-sass gulp-notify gulp-rename gulp-autoprefixer</code>
</pre>

Then run 'gulp'.
